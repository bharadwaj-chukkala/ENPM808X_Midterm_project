## Overview
### ACME Robotics Problem Statement
Obstacle Detection has become an essential need in todayâ€™s technologically advanced world and the need for Automation has fueled this application. In day to day life we notice many accidents on the shopfloor between humans and semi-autonomous machinery. Assuming an industrial environment/warehouse setup where there is constant human-robot interaction on the ground which is a likely place prone to accidents, ACME Robotics needs to upgrade their AGV such that these accidents are avoided as much as possible. The workfloor/shopfloor contains automated guided vehicles for the transportation of mechanical/electrical components and other products. There is an urgent need for a way to avoid imminent collisions between humans and AGVs. Although the pedestrians on the shopfloor/warehouse can be wary of the AGVs there has to be a way for the AGVs to detect human obstacles to avoid collision and collateral damage. 
### Goal
We are going to develop a perception module that will be interfaced with the ACME Robotics AGV to constantly detect and track moving humans. This module has to  be developed such that it seemlessly integrates with all the other subsystems of the AGV and provide continuous data feedback to avoid collision. The algorithm can be extended to detect other AGVs and Environment Variables so that the work floor is safe.
### Aim of the Product
This ACME Robotics Product will use the Perception Module vision data alongside the sensor feedback, to avoid collision and choose a different path to traverse through the environment based on human detection and tracking from the continuous video input data stream, thus avoiding human collision by maintaining safe distance.
### Perception Module Description
The Software Product will consist of 4 modules which will take a continuous video input and will provide bounded output after detecting humans and will track the humans as they move in real time.
  - Perception Module will initialize all the software modules and has a functionality to integrate everything together 
  - Data Reader Module will take continuous video input, resize the frame and perform image transformations and then return the output to Classifier Module.
  - Classifier Module works using an SVM Model, To train the model we generate a Histogram of Gradients for the given dataser. The generated feature vectors will be used to train the SVM Classifier. The Classifier will detect the location of the feature (Human) in the input frames with an error bound. The Output Error will be calculated between the ground truth and the classified output and it will be iterated through and through to minimize error and improve feature detection accuracy. After the desired accuracy is being reached, the Classifer Module will help the Human Detector Module to draw bounding boxes as it keeps classifying the human in the input.
  - Human Detector Module will detect the person in the input as frames are extracted, it will draw bounding boxes as identification of the detected person from the classifier output and return the bounding box output data for each frame continuously.
